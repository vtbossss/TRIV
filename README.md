## **Features**

### üå± **Real-Time Data Collection**
- Integrates with the Agromonitoring satellite data api to fetch **soil and vegetation indices** (e.g., NDVI).
- Streams real-time soil and vegetation data using **Kafka**.

### üìä **Interactive 3D Visualization**
- Utilizes **three.js** for 3D chart rendering, offering intuitive and interactive data exploration.
- Visualizes complex agricultural datasets for enhanced precision and understanding.

### üì° **Real-Time Updates**
- Powered by **WebSockets** to deliver live updates for soil health and vegetation conditions.
- Implements **Kafka Streams** for high-throughput, low-latency data processing.

### üåç **Polygon-Based Data Handling**
- Currently supports a single polygon for data collection and analysis, with plans for user-defined polygons in future updates.

### üöÄ **Scalability & Performance**
- Deployed in a Dockerized environment with **NGINX** as a reverse proxy for optimal performance.
- Designed to handle high volumes of data while maintaining responsiveness.
