# Interactive 3D Data Visualization Tool

## Overview

Data analysis is critical across various domains, such as finance, healthcare, and agriculture. However, traditional 2D charts often fall short in effectively conveying the complexity of multidimensional datasets. This project aims to develop an **interactive 3D data visualization tool** that enhances the way users explore and interpret data by leveraging modern web technologies.

### Technologies Used
- **Three.js:** For rendering 3D graphs and charts.
- **Python:** For backend data processing and real-time data fetching.
- **GASP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** For creating smooth and interactive animations.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Data Processing:** Fetch and process data from various sources (e.g., financial markets, healthcare metrics, environmental statistics) using Python.
- **3D Visualizations:** Display multidimensional data in an interactive 3D format, allowing users to rotate, zoom, and explore the data from different angles.
- **Interactive Animations:** Utilize GASP to enhance user engagement with dynamic animations that highlight trends, filter data, and provide a richer visual experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Node.js (for serving the frontend)
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Python

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Required Python Packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up the Frontend:**
   - Navigate to the frontend directory and install necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```

4. **Run the Backend Server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Run the Frontend Application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. **Access the Application:**
   - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Usage

- **Data Exploration:** Use the interactive controls to filter data, zoom in/out, and rotate the 3D visualizations to gain insights.
- **Real-Time Updates:** The application will automatically fetch and update data in real-time, allowing users to analyze the latest information.
